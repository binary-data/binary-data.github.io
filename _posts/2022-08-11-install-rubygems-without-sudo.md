You don't want to clutter your system with extra ruby gems, don't you?

### Solution

The option is to install gems to a folder in your home. The `gem install` command has an option just for that:
- `--user-install` installs gems in the userâ€™s home directory instead of `GEM_HOME`.

So the command may look like this:
```shell
gem install --user-install jekyll
```

### The .gemrc file

To avoid typing the options every time, we could add them to the `~/.gemrc` file:
```yaml
---
gem: --user-install
install: --no-document # avoids generating documentation, you may omit this option
```
And then just type
```shell
gem install jekyll
```

### PATH
If you see a warning

```
WARNING:  You don't have /home/anton/.local/share/gem/ruby/bin in your PATH,
          gem executables will not run.
```

make sure to add the provided bin directory to the `$PATH`. Usually, this is done in shell configuration files like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zhsrc`:

```shell
export PATH=$HOME/.gems/bin:$PATH
```

Reload the terminal or use

```shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

after edit so that new paths will be available.

### Debugging
To see the current paths, use the `gem environment` command. By default, it loads your `~/.gemrc`. It will give you the following output:
